# Amazon-Expense-Reporting-tool
Ever wondered how much money you are spending on Amazon Prime? Unfortunately, Amazon seems to have removed this report. This is a small program to parse sequential data saved into a text file by "screen scraping" your raw transactions into an organized CSV file for numerical analysis.

Please see sample "screen scrape, Amazon Orders.txt", place this file into your \Amazon Expense Reporting Tool\bin\Debug\net6.0 folder to produce output files. 

There is no GUI.
